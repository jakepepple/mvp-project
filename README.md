There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Introducing "What's My Time?"

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  An app that analyzes your timing through a game interface, and coaches you appropriately based on your results.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  What's My Time (WMT) is a web-based app that helps users discover how consistent their timing and reflexes are through a game-like interface. After their results are reported, WMT coaches users to improve their results by curating YouTube lessons for their specific needs.  All results are saved to a user profile, so users can come back to the app to try to improve their best scores.  

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Musicians and athletes make their careers off of timing and reflexes. If these individuals have inconsistent or poor timing, their musical or athletic success may suffer. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  WMT helps musicians and athletes improve their timing with a simple, fun game that also can track their progress towards their goals. Users sign in to the app, and can see their current best score(if applicable), and play the game to try and improve it. The game consists of an on-screen prompt that flashes at a consistent interval, and users try to press a key as closely timed to the prompt as possible. When complete, they receive their results, as well as potential coaching videos to help them improve.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "What's My Time has helped me in my professional drumming career by coaching me to improve my timing daily, without being overly time-consuming or difficult to use." <i>-Jake Pepple</i>

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  All users have to do is navigate to the site in a web browser, sign up for a username (optional), and can then play the game to receive their personal results/coaching videos. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "What's My Time has helped me in my daily life by improving my overall reflexes. I have felt more alert to my surroundings and am now avoiding the clumsiness that stemmed from my poor reflexes." <i>-WMT User</i>
## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
